# image_segmentation_optimization

## Goal
- Gain the ability to select the best optimizer for deep learning-based medical image segmantation
- Understand what the optimization is in terms of deep learning
### Stretch Goal
- Implement more accurate and faster optimizer

## Background
### Segmentation architectures
#### [U-Net architecture](#ref-4)
- Known for precise segmentation with smaller size of traning dataset
### [Optimizer](#ref-4)
1. SGD
    - Optimizer with fixed LR/MR
2. AdaGrad
    - Optimizer with adaptive LR
3. ADAM
    - Optimizer with adaptive LR/MR
### [Evaluation](#ref-3)
- Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC)
    - F-meature based metrics
- Cohen's Kappa (Kap)
- Average Hausdorff Distance (AHD)
### Medical Image
#### Heart
- Small traning dataset with large variability
#### Chromosome
- Large traning dataset
- Main challenge is the separation of overlapping chromosomes

## Success Measure
- Draw a comparison table for each optimizer with its evaluation metrics
